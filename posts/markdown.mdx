Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default (props) => <h1>Highlighting</h1>;
```

<br />

<div>
  Let`s try button here.
  <Button>Just click it</Button>
</div>

### Let`s try CodeBlock here

```
  // this is a code block in md syntax
  const sayHi = () => {
    return console.log('h1')
  }
```

<CodeBlock>
  {`
     const sayHi = () => {
       return console.log('hi)
     }
  `}
</CodeBlock>
